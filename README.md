# Hand-Controlled-Car-Game-Using-Machine-Learning-and-OpenCV


Hand-Controlled Car Game

A fun and interactive car game controlled by hand movements using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pygame. This project utilizes real-time hand tracking to control the car's movement on screen, offering a unique experience where users can steer and navigate through obstacles with their hands. The game features dynamic obstacle spawning, coin collection, and a scoring system. The hand tracking is powered by MediaPipe, while Pygame handles the game mechanics and graphics. Perfect for experimenting with hand tracking and creating engaging user experiences.

Technologies used:

OpenCV for webcam capture
MediaPipe for hand tracking
Pygame for game development and rendering
Multithreading for efficient processing
